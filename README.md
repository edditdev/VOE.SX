## What does this script do?

- **Intercepts `.m3u8` URLs** by hooking into the browser's `fetch` API and `XMLHttpRequest` calls.
- Displays a **floating panel** on the webpage showing all unique `.m3u8` URLs captured in real-time.
- Allows you to **copy URLs to clipboard** by clicking either the URL entry or the copy button.
- Automatically **copies the first captured URL** to your clipboard for instant use.
- Tries to **simulate user gestures** to auto-play video elements, helping trigger streams on some pages.
- Styled with a modern, transparent glassmorphism effect and smooth animations for great UX.

## How does it work?

The script overrides native browser functions used for network requests (`fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest`) to detect URLs containing `.m3u8`. Whenever such a URL is requested, it is added to the visible panel if it hasn't been seen before.

Each URL entry shows the current page title and the full URL. Clicking the entry or the clipboard icon copies the URL to your clipboard and shows a tooltip confirmation.

The panel can be closed by clicking the top-right ‚úï button, and it automatically adds a custom font and styles dynamically to the page.
